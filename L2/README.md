See the details for L2 from here: http://www.cs.ubbcluj.ro/~dan/ma/labPlan.html

In this repository you should maintain your work for the L2 project for both of the projects (Native and Non-Native).
Eg. You can have a directory structure like this:
- android - for the native project.
- flutter - for non-native project.
- server - the server that will be used by both of the above projects.
